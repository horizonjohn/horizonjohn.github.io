Hi there! Thanks for visiting my page. 👋

🔭 My research interests are <u>Deep Learning and Its Applications</u>.

I have a strong `interdisciplinary` background. I truly enjoy exploring the intersection of these fields, and my vision is to develop and integrate various insights into surroundings to enhance our living efficiency and quality.

🔍 <b>Master</b>: My focus primarily revolved around leveraging AI technologies to assist designers in enhancing their design process:
- <b>Generative AI</b>: Diffusion Models, GANs, AutoEncoder, Vision Transformers.
- <b>Efficient Learning</b>: Self-Supervised Learning, Multi-Modal Learning.

🔍 <b>Undergraduate</b>: I gained extensive experience in various engineering projects with the following interconnected aspects: 
- <b>Microcontroller Development</b>: Jetson Nano, Raspberry Pi, Stm32, PLC.
- <b>Deep Learning</b>: Image Classfication, Object Detection.
- <b>PCB Design</b>: Altium Designer.
- <b>Mechanical Modeling and Analysis</b>: SolidWorks, Ansys.

<u>Starting in my freshman year</u>, I joined the Dean’s research group and participated in three projects. The final project, for which I was responsible, achieved <b>notable</b> results. It led to a breakthrough in the textile field, passed a formal technical appraisal, and facilitated collaborations with several leading companies in the industry. <u>Furthermore</u>, I actively participated in various technological competitions and campus activities to enrich my academic experience and campus life as a whole.
